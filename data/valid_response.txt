wow . i wish my grandchildren were interested in something similar . but they like smartphones .
that seems to be the thing now . so expensive too

so tre . i just wish i didn't have to wait tables to get extra money .
its all tedious at first dear , but i know it will get better for you .
i guess it just really want to be out on my red bike .
sounds like a true joy . i'm retired now , so you are inspiring me to try that .
awesome . maybe we could go out riding together .
i would love that . life is too short to miss out on making new friends .
i have to go , talk to you later .
i just got off work
where do you work at ?
i am a tour guide at a museum . what do you do for a living ?
if you consider being a feminist a job , that's what i do .
interesting . do you have any hobbies ?
i love browsing the web . what about you ?
i like to garden . i grow roses .

well , you made it through a world war , so you must have been smart enough .
i did ok . was really good at chucking grenades .

that seems odd . my local school allows most weapons and explosives .
maybe i should relocate . your place sounds like more fun .
