sim3 spec3s spec3 ppld5 do you eat shawarma while you clean ? that's my fav food .
sim4 spec5s spec4 ppld4 no , but i do sing folk songs to make work go easier .
sim1 spec2s spec2 ppld5 singing and cleaning . my grandpa and i served in the world war .
sim3 spec4s spec4 ppld4 together ? that's interesting . do either of you play any instruments ?
sim5 spec5s spec5 ppld4 ya it was a great experience . used to play wood blocks , you ?
sim5 spec5s spec5 ppld4 i tickle the ivories , strum on the guitar , and sing . i want to be rich and famous .

sim4 spec5s spec4 ppld5 i've never worked in fast food , but i do love burgers !
sim4 spec3s spec4 ppld5 fast food , is miserable won't lie . my father wanted me to take over his construction company
sim4 spec4s spec3 ppld4 my parents never owned much , but there was never a shortage of love .
sim5 spec4s spec3 ppld5 my father could not show love , so i grew up with a lot of materialistic items
sim4 spec1s spec5 ppld4 my natural parents couldn't show love either . i am adopted , you see .
sim1 spec3s spec2 ppld1 well , maybe it was more than just lack of love
sim1 spec1s spec3 ppld1 i am sorry to hear that you grew up like that .
sim1 spec3s spec1 ppld1 it happens , do you have any hobbies ?
sim5 spec4s spec3 ppld4 yeah , i love getting outside in my garden . what about you ?

sim4 spec3s spec2 ppld2 i want to learn but i'm not sure
sim5 spec2s spec2 ppld3 you should learn ! i can make all of my own clothes .
sim3 spec4s spec5 ppld4 that would save a lot of money

sim4 spec4s spec5 ppld5 number 24 under the red alert section . red alert means high probability .
sim5 spec3s spec5 ppld5 death is not so bad . it is grey and a lot like working overtime
sim4 spec4s spec5 ppld5 my only hobby that does not illicit potential death is knitting . do you like to knit ?
sim5 spec5s spec5 ppld5 my mom knitted me a grey and brown scorpion once . i hate her .
sim5 spec5s spec5 ppld5 death by mother made scorpion is number 1068 on my list . i knit all my lists .

sim5 spec5s spec5 ppld4 hello . do you walk the road of spirituality ?
sim1 spec2s spec5 ppld5 not really i tend to walk the road to the nearest shopping mall ! lol
sim3 spec4s spec4 ppld4 understandable friend . the materialistic life has its appeal .
sim5 spec3s spec5 ppld5 unfortunately for me that means my home is filled with shoes and clothing . you ?
sim1 spec4s spec5 ppld4 my home is filled with only the essentials for survival .
sim4 spec3s spec5 ppld5 you sound very centered . i like my life , my family doesn t seem to .
sim3 spec5s spec5 ppld4 perhaps . but i live a life of solitude . i miss family .
sim5 spec2s spec4 ppld5 i like solitude too . maybe that s why i m infatuated with time and watches .
sim4 spec2s spec5 ppld5 time given physical form is indeed intriguing . but meditation is my infatuation .
sim1 spec5s spec5 ppld5 isn t meditation just like napping ?
sim4 spec4s spec4 ppld5 spiritual napping . full time spiritual napping . it has been three months since i talked in fact .
sim5 spec2s spec5 ppld5 i have to talk . i work at a discount watch dealer . time out . heard of them ?
sim5 spec3s spec5 ppld5 i've not . no watch dealers out here in the tundra .
sim5 spec5s spec5 ppld5 we ship anywhere . our motto is tick tick , losing track of time is sick
sim5 spec4s spec4 ppld5 i respect that dedication . but i must go . the bears have breached my homestead fence .
sim5 spec5s spec5 ppld5 i drive a german car , what kind of car do you drive ?
sim4 spec5s spec5 ppld5 i drive my boyfriends ford raptor .
sim2 spec5s spec3 ppld4 never heard of the ford raptor .
